# Gotest Script

A custom script to simplify the execution of Go tests on specific files and functions, ensuring that tests are run from the correct project path.

## Overview
The go test command executes by default in the path where the file is located, but in the project, there are many configurations in the project's default path. The gotest script solves the execution path issue.
The `gotest` script is designed to address the common issue of `go test` commands not being executed in the correct project directory. It takes two arguments: the file name and the function name, and runs the test accordingly.

## Usage

To use the `gotest` script, simply pass the file and function name as arguments:

```bash
./gotest <FunctionName>
Installation
Clone the repository containing the gotest script.
Change to the directory containing the script.
Make the script executable with the following command:
bash
chmod +x gotest
Optionally, move the script to a directory in your PATH for easier access.
Example
To run a test on the example_test.go file for the TestExample function, you would use:

bash
./gotest TestExample
